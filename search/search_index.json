ROS2: As of this writing the most current distribution of ROS2 is Humble Hawksbill. Enter ROS2 Documentation: Humble and choose Ubuntu (Debian). Follow the steps there including Setup locale, Setup Sources, Install ROS2 packages. Then, run the desktop installation command line to have all the ROS2 tools. By the end of the previous part, you should have /\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60/\u210e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52 directory.

Running ROS2 Node: A node is a python file. We will write our first nodes according to fixed template I will show later in Writing ROS2 Node section. To run a ROS2 node we can make the file to be executable (using \ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51 command) and just run it like: \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b3<\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc41_\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc38_\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc38_\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc38> Good to Know: When you are writing python file, you can use \ud835\udc60\u210e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 in the first code line. It is a line starts with #! that sets the interpreter which will run the code. Usually will be: #!/\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5f/\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b/\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b3 That way we will run a node like: ./<\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc41_\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc38_\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc38> Install ROS2 Node into Workspace: we don\u2019t want to run nodes like above because it is not scalable. Instead, we will install the nodes. We do so using the \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d.\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc66 .

In this dictionary, there is a \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 key which contains an array. This array is the place where we are telling ROS2 which nodes it should know. When we will build the package later, ROS2 will take the python filles we put there and make executables from them. The location where these executables we be stored in is written in the \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d.\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc54 file.

In this dictionary, there is a \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60 key which contains an array. This array is the place where we are telling ROS2 which nodes it should know. When we will build the package later, ROS2 will take the python filles we put there and make executables from them. The location where these executables we be stored in is written in the \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d.\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc54 file.

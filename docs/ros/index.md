# ROS2 For Beginners

## Install ROS2 and Setup Your Environment:
I assume you have a virtual machine with Linux distribution on it (like Ubuntu).
Use 𝑠𝑢𝑑𝑜 𝑎𝑝𝑡 𝑢𝑝𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 , 𝑠𝑢𝑑𝑜 𝑎𝑝𝑡 𝑢𝑝𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒 , 𝑠𝑢𝑑𝑜 𝑎𝑝𝑡 𝑎𝑢𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒 to make sure your system is up to date.

### VS-code:
Add three main extensions – C/C++, CMake, Python.
Make sure you have python installed: 𝑠𝑢𝑑𝑜 𝑎𝑝𝑡 𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑛3−𝑝𝑖𝑝

NEW COMMAND: 𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡 – opens files in a more comfortable user interface.

For example: 𝑔𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡 ~/.𝑏𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑟𝑐.
